So, before you'll get this error on your Docker instance I presume you have basic knowledge of Docker and as such won't need to explain but rather straight to the error and solution options.

### The Error

The error is gotten when you run the below command on a set of projects that include a React App.

    docker-composer up

or try to start a React App container from an image on your Docker instance.

### For the simplest solution, Skip to <a href="#option-5">Option 5</a> :wink:

### Option 1

#### (While Running Multiple Containers)

> Add the configuration "tty:true" to your react instance

    	react:
    			tty: true //NOTE
    			build: dockerreact
    			ports: - "3000:3000"

### Option 2

#### (While Running Multiple Containers)

> Setting "stdin_open:true" to your react instance

    	react:
    			stdin_open: true //NOTE:
    			build: dockerreact
    			ports: - "3000:3000"

### Option 3

#### (While Running Multiple Containers or Single React Container)

> Add "CI=true" as a command that should run before "npm install" in your Dockerfile within your React project root directory

    FROM node:14.5

    RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/app
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app

    COPY package.json /usr/src/app

    RUN CI=true //NOTE

    RUN npm install
    COPY . /usr/src/app

    EXPOSE 3000
    CMD ["npm","start"]

### Option 4

#### (While Running Multiple Containers or Single React Container)

> Use "docker-compose run" instead of "docker-compose up" as this automatically sets either option 1 or 2 as true

    docker-compose run

NOTE: This is only works on already built docker images

### Option 5

#### (While Running Multiple Containers or Single React Container)

> Lastly, Degrade your "react scripts" version to 3.4.0

NOTE: Degradding to 3.3.0 wont solve the error.
